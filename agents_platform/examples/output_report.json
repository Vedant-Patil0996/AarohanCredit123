This suggests that while your account balance may experience significant swings, the underlying patterns and rhythm of your cash flow are relatively consistent and predictable.

The repayment pattern score of 90 is also very strong. While there are concerns regarding balance volatility, Invoice Financing is a suitable product because it is secured against specific, verifiable receivables, which mitigates the risk associated with general account balance fluctuations. The business's consistent operational activity supports the viability of this product.",

Three critical red flags have been identified: high balance volatility, frequent rapid balance changes (5 instances), and a low minimum balance (\u20b935,000.0). These indicators suggest potential challenges in managing day-to-day liquidity and make the business ineligible for general-purpose loans like Working Capital or Term Loans, as these products typically require more consistent and stable general account balances to ensure timely repayment."
